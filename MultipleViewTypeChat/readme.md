This app demonstartes how to handle multiple layouts in a recycler view. In this app the user has a provision to send a message as a sender and a receiver. The user can enter his message 
and a value (1 sender or 2 receiver), if the message is sent by the sender then we populate the messages in the right side of the screen and if the message is sent by the receiver then
the messages are populated in the left side of the screen. Both the sender and receiver chats have different layouts.
